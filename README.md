**homecast - homemade meteorological forecast**

This repository is currently a private fun-project which aims into building automatic temperature forecasts for a friend of mine with freely available data of a meteorological station, which he is also maintaining.

As basis we use the 'near real-time' observations for temperature of the Hydrographic Service of Carinthia, which are delayed about 15 minutes and available in a 15 minute interval.
